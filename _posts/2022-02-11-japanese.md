I am a native Azerbaijani Turkic speaker, and I am interested in learning languages. While learning the Japanese language, I have found that the Japanese and Turkic languages have some similarities. I am not a linguist, and I do not have any claim about the causes of such similarities. But I have read some scattered articles about the root of the Japanese language, and I know that there are some claims that Japanese is a mixed Altaic-Austronesian language. 

I think such experiences and thoughts of a native Turkic speaker who learns Japanese would be worthy of writing. Also, I know that, while comparing languages, it is essential to compare the very first forms of the stems, suffixes, and grammar. Despite my knowledge of classic Turkic literature, I am not familiar with classical Japanese grammar or vocabulary, which may cause some errors in my comparisons.
