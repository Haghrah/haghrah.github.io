I am a native Turkic speaker, and I am interested in learning languages. While learning the Japanese language, I have found that the Japanese and Turkic languages have some similarities. I am not a linguist, and I do not have any claim about the causes of such similarities. But I think such experiences and thoughts of a native Turkic speaker who learns Japanese would be worthy of writing.
